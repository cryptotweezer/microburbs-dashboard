    "description": "Some houses feel right from the moment you arrive... not because they're flashy or over the top, but because they're real. They're lived in, loved, and cared for. They're the kind of home where every corner holds a memory, where the front door has welcomed friends for years, and where family laughter has filled the rooms. This is one of those homes.\nHeld by the same family for decades, it has been carefully maintained, thoughtfully updated, and always treated with pride. It sits in a quiet, friendly cul-de-sac where neighbours still wave, yet it's close enough to walk to conveniences, ride to the beach, and enjoy all the things that make this location so sought after.\nIt's the Goldilocks home; not too big, not too small, but just right. Families will love the extra living space and easy layout, retirees will love the one-level living and manageable garden. And everyone will love the feeling that life here just works.\nHere's What You'll Love:\n* Easy-care home with so many positives, perfect for downsizing or that second home upsize\n* Quiet, family and retiree-friendly cul-de-sac street, you will enjoy where you live\n* Immaculate presentation with dual living spaces, updated bathroom and laundry\n* Entry into a large front carpeted living room with downlights and sun-filled window\n* Flowing through to an open-plan living and dining area from a thoughtful extension\n* Dining connects to an open-style living space overlooking the second living and backyard\n* Timber floorboards, skylights, curved feature walls, timber ceiling panelling, and downlights\n* Kitchen with neutral tones, tiled splashback, large bench space, and central island\n* Cabinetry on both walls offering generous storage and connection between dining and living\n* Rear second living area providing extra space and direct access to the backyard\n* Rear of the property is private and north-facing, inviting warm winter light indoors\n* Smart floorplan with bedroom wing tucked away from both living spaces for privacy\n* Large main bedroom at the front with carpet, ceiling fan, and connected extra bedroom as a walk-in robe\n* Current walk-in robe is fully fitted but can be restored to the original bedroom\n* Third and fourth bedrooms are carpeted, have ceiling fans, are freshly painted, and the fourth overlooks the backyard\n* Updated main bathroom with freestanding shower, toilet, modern vanity, and on-trend colour palette\n* Additional powder room off the corridor to the second living area, ideal for guests\n* Functional layout with two toilets and multiple living areas to suit both growing families and downsizers\n* Fully fenced backyard with established greenery, level paved and decked entertaining areas\n* Grass space for kids, grandkids, and pets, flowing to the former pool area now decked over for low maintenance\n* Under the timber deck lies a concrete swimming pool, ready to restore and refill if desired\n* Pool installation costs are high today, but here the structure is already in place, details available on request\n* Landscaped gardens with easy-care planting, flowing to a flat backyard visible from the kitchen\n* Long lock-up garage with under-house storage and workshop space\n* Just minutes' drive to miles of beach for swimming, surfing, and 4WD adventures\n* Close to Fernleigh Track for cycling and walking, plus local lakefront clubs including Belmont 16s and Lake Macquarie Yacht Club\n* Nearby childcare options include Kinda Kapers and Great Beginnings, with Belmont Christian College and Belmont North Public close by\n* Short drive to Belmont foreshore, shops, supermarkets, cafs, and essential services\n* Around 25 minutes to Newcastle CBD and 90 minutes to Sydney\nThere's a kind of comfort in finding a home that feels like it's already a part of your story. One that has been lived in and loved, yet still feels fresh and ready for the years ahead. This is that home. With a layout that works as beautifully for quiet moments as it does for hosting a full house, and a location that connects you to the very best of coastal and lakeside living, it's the move that will feel right the second you step inside.\nCome & Besold...\n* Disclaimer:\nAll information contained herein is gathered from sources we deem reliable.
